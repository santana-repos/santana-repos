üëã Greetings! I'm Thiago, an expert in software engineering with over two decades of experience in web development and business growth, having contributed to successful projects across diverse markets: 

- *Open Insurance*: I collaborated with Itau Seguros and to the Open Insurance Brazil partnership, working with technical specialist teams to improve the ‚Äòquote patrimonial‚Äô OpenAPI3 specification. This made it easier for participating companies to implement it, showcasing my understanding of API-first design principles.

- *Information Security Application*: I contributed to Zup Innovation in growing their information security application product business opportunities in the market. I also collaborated on a restructure for an information security application, coordinating a Development Team in a complete application codebase refactoring process, and helped an SRE Team to review their application‚Äôs architecture and DevOps strategy.

- *Banking and Payments Market*: I contributed to Cielo, a leading payment solutions company in Latin America, in implementing their governance artifacts (guidelines, blueprints, and KPIs) to support the development teams in ensuring the APIs are secure, semantically correct, and easy to consume and understand. This led to the expansion of business opportunities and strategic partnerships, including one with Meta that brought the feature to send and receive money to the Brazilian version of WhatsApp.

- *Software Development Market*: I was part of a talented team that prepared the technical content for a demonstration presented by Mulesoft‚Äôs CTO at the Mulesoft CONNECT 2028 event. This allowed Mulesoft, a Salesforce company, to showcase their new products and solutions, strengthen existing client relationships, and generate leads for new business opportunities.

- *Insurance Services Market*: I worked with BNP Paribas Cardif to implement performance fine-tuning, increase testing coverage, and improve maintainability of the existing card payment feature. I also implemented a new two-credit-card payment method for the insurance subscription checkout page, making the company a pioneer in the country‚Äôs market for offering this type of payment option.

- *Telecommunications Market*: I contributed to a project that provided non-customers with the opportunity to evaluate the QoS (Quality of Services) offered by America M√≥vil‚Äôs internet solutions (NetServi√ßo/Claro), encouraging them to subscribe and become new customers.

- *Financial Brokerage Services Market*: At HSBC Global Banking and Markets Brazil, I helped develop a new sign-in method for the investment web portal. This not only improved user experience but also ensured a secure authentication process.

- *Commercial Automation Market*: I customized CentOS Linux to create a LiveUSB installer for Zanthus, a specialized commercial automation service provider. This reduced the setup time for new POS workstations from 5 hours to just 10 minutes. Additionally, I developed several Batch Scripting satellite apps to automate the configuration process, further reducing human intervention time.

Now, I‚Äôm eager to assist you in enhancing your business journey and achieving extraordinary success.  Furthermore, I‚Äôve earned relevant *certifications*:
